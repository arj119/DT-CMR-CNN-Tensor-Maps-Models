# DT-CMR-CNN-Tensor-Maps-Models
In this repository, we are looking to investigate CNN models for image-to-image translation with the aim of producing tensor maps from undersampled data.

DT-CMR is a unique and emerging technique capable of providing information on the heart's myocardial micro-architecture. This innovative technology provides an insight into the poorly understood link between cellular contraction and macroscopic cardiac function. It also offers huge potential for novel microstructure and functional assessment, and for the development and evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches.
